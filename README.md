# Automobile Dataset: Cleaning & Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project uses the **Automobile dataset** to explore how car specifications affect prices.  
It focuses on **data cleaning, preprocessing, correlation analysis, and simple linear regression** to predict car prices based on `highway-mpg`.

## 🛠️ Key Steps
- Handled missing values (mean/mode replacement)  
- Converted data types and cleaned invalid entries  
- Performed correlation analysis (Pearson correlation)  
- Built a linear regression model with `sklearn`
